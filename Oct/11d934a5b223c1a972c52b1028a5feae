 On Wednesday afternoon hundreds of taxi drivers blocked the N11 road at Doornkop but allowed vehicles through, said motorists who travel the road. Later on the group of protesters were seen along Walter Sisulu street at the Wonderpark Centre where again they attempted to block the N11 route. Messages on emergency groups on Thursday morning stated that roads were partially closed for only short periods of time, and quickly dispersed as police arrived. Members of the public also reported being affected through delays and roadblocks. A representative of Middelburg United Long Distance Taxi Association (MULDTA), who only identified himself as Charlie, was unable to reveal more details on the matter on Thursday morning, saying that a statement would be released later during the day. It is unclear if the matter could be resolved before then. There were no reports of further trouble on the roads on Thursday morning.
